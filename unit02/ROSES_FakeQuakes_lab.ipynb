    "The purpose of this exercise is to get familiar with the parameters and functions used to generate synthetic data using the forward modeling code FakeQuakes from the [MudPy](https://github.com/dmelgarm/MudPy) Github repository. FakeQuakes was created by __Dr. Diego Melgar__ (professor at the Unviersity of Oregon), and most of the components are outlined in the paper [__Kinematic rupture scenarios and synthetic displacement data: An example application to the Cascadia subduction zone__ (Melgar et al., 2016)](http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/2016JB013314).  \n",

    "This set of codes generates synthetic rupture models and can generate low frequency displacement waveforms and broadband acceleration waveforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this lab, we will be using data from the Mentawai, Indonesia region.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information on how to use FakeQuakes, you can refer to this [wiki page](https://github.com/taranye96/tsuquakes/wiki/FakeQuakes-Script) on my github account.  This wiki page walks you through how to set up the parameter file (__.fq.py__) listed in the [tsuquakes](https://github.com/taranye96/tsuquakes) respository and how to run the different steps in FakeQuakes.  If you have any other questions, feel free to contact me or Diego Melgar.\n",
