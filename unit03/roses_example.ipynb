    "In this notebook, we will walk through the steps of Ambient Noise Tomography. The first step will be extracting the Green's functions from ambient seismic noise. The next step will be measuring the dispersion curve from the extracted Green's function. Then, we will use a previously created dataset to perform a 2-D tomographic inversion, and finish with a synthetic test of the tomographic inversion."

The trend and mean of the data are removed, gaps are filled with zeros, the sampling frequency is downsampled from 40 Hz to 3 Hz, and the instrument response is removed. In this case I've already downloaded the data, but one may use this to download data of your own. In this case only 5 days of data is used, which is a very short period for ambient noise tomography. In order to get good results one may need many months or even years of data. NoisePy offers scripts to either download data or re-organize an existing dataset on your local machine."

    "In this next cell, all the parameters needed to set up the cross-correlation are defined. In this case, the recorded time series will be broken into thirty minute segments. The step size is 15 minutes, leading to an overlap of 50%. In this case, both frequency and time domain normalization is used. The time domain normalization used in this example is one-bit normalization. This means that only the sign of the time series recorded at each station is saved. This is done to reduce the effect of transient signals such as earthquakes. A running mean average is applied to the amplitude spectrum of the signal, with a window length of 100 samples. This smooths the frequency content of the signal. The data will also be bandpass filtered between 0.25 Hz and 1 Hz, as this is the frequency range we are interested in for this example. The maximum time lag to be saved is 200 seconds, meaning that the cross-correlation will be saved from -200 to 200 seconds. Any signals greater than 10 times the standard deviation of the normalized and filtered signal will be removed."

    "There are two further steps to go from a set of dispersion curves to a 3-D map of the subsurface. The first step is to make a 2-D period map. When we measure a dispersion curve between two stations. We are observing the effects of the subsurface over the entire distance along these two stations. The purpose of the 2-D period map is to determine where along this path the variations in velocity occur. Here I'll use seismic-noise-tomography, produced by Dr. Bruno Gotourbes as the framework for developing these 2-D period maps. I'll go through the tomography workflow step by step, although I have also included a wrapper function called `invert4model` in rosesutils that can be used to do the same thing but more concisely."

Ideally we could calculate the inverse of the weigh matrix, such that $\\textbf{G}^{-1}\\textbf{d} = \\textbf{m}$. However, reality may be more complicated. In many cases G may be singular, or too large to invert, so more sophisticated approaches are often required.\n",

The values of $\\textbf{G}$ represent the integration of slowness (1 / velocity) through each grid node. For each raypath, the weights in $\\textbf{G}$ will be non-zero for the nodes that the ray samples, while the weights in $\\textbf{G}$ will be zero if the raypath does not sample them.

    "There we go, that's the end of the lab! We've created a 2-D map of surface wave velocities at one period. While a lot of shortcuts were taken to produce this image, we can still see some features that correspond to known geology. Notably, the effect of the Congo Craton is observed as a high velocity anomaly in the south-east corner of the map. In order to make further inferences about the geology, it would be useful to create a 3-D shear wave velocity model. This is generally done by extracting the velocities at each period for one geographic location. The 1-D dispersion curve that results from this can then be inverted for the shear wave structure at that location. Doing this for each geographic location in the study grid produces a pseudo 3-D model, with a 1-D shear wave model at each grid node. I'll save this problem for another day. Here are some codes that may be used for this purpose.\n",
